                <p>
                    In an attempt to design an interface that allows users to filter, sort, and favorite songs and then view their 
                    favorited songs in an aggregator. To accomplish this, I first analyzed and compared five desktop music platforms with 
                    these features: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.deezer.com/us/channels/explore/explore-tab">Deezer</a>, and <a href="https://music.youtube.com/">Youtube Music</a>. I then took my findings and created 
                    my interface using React.js.

                <h3>The Interfaces</h3>
                <p>Below are video walkthroughs showcasing the UserInterfaces to explore, favorite, and view songs in the aggregator for the desktop sites of Spotify, 
                    Youtube Music, and Deezer. It may be important to note that the free versions of each of these applications were used.</p>

                <h3>Competitive Comparison Chart</h3>

                <p>Below is a competitive comparison chart with my findings from comparing the filter, sorting, and favoriting features of songs in 
                    Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer, Amazon Music, and and Youtube Music. More specifically, I looked at the desktop interface where users can search through 
                    songs and favorites them, including how users can filter and sort the songs they're looking through, and I looked at the aggregator of favorited songs 
                    on each of these desktop apps.
                </p>

                    While Spotify, Deezer, and Apple Music all present individual songs in similar forms–as horizontally-spanning rectangles listed one on top of the other–their favoriting interfaces have 
                    notable differences. Spotify's greatest shortcoming was the lack of sorting within lists of songs, both explored and within the liked songs aggregator.
                    It's sucess, in my opinion, lies primarily in the sleekness of the interface, which includes the presentation of relevant information of each song without over-cluttering the space. 
                    Deezer, on the other hand, seems to showcase too much information about each song, both when exploring songs and in the aggregator. This clutter of unnecessary information could pose issues 
                    with clarity and overwhelming users, although the use of white space seems to rectify the possible issue. I do think that Deezer could benefit from an alterate view of songs withing the aggregator, much 
                    like Spotify's compressed view option. Deezer's strength, ubdoubtedly, is its sorting options available for all songs lists, both in the liked songs and explore sections. 
                    
                    Youtube Music had the weakest UI in my opinion. The obvious issue is the lack of efficiency in liking songs: it takes a user 
                    three clicks to add a song to the favorited list, and the favoriting feature seems to be hidden, causing issues with efficiency and learnability. 
                    There are also no sorting options within song lists, both exporable and favorited. I do enjoy the easy navigation of filtering songs by moods and genres, and consider it one of Youtube Music's few sucesses in terms of UI.

            </div>
          
            <div id="My-Design" class="my-favoriting-site">
                <h2>My Design</h2>
                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p> From the above competitive analysis, I created the following list of factors and designs to incorporate in my own design:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Sorting both within discoverable items and within the aggregator</li>
                        <li> Hovering over an item shows favorite button (Spotify)</li>
                        <li> Delay after unfavoriting an item before it's removed from the aggregator to allow user to refavorite</li>
                        <li> Filtering by categories common to items (Youtube Music). In the context of songs, I'd like to expand this to allow for multiple genre filters 
                            to be available at once in otrder to capture more niche sub-genres and cross-genre spaces.</li>
                        <li> I'd like to incorporate at least one sort based on the qualities of a song... i.e. if a song is happy or mellow. This will hopefully help users not just 
                            sort songs based on their titles or lenght, but also based on the contents of the songs themselves.</li>
                        <li> Liking a song takes a single click </li>
                        <li> Hovering and button clicks show extraneous information rather than having it visible at all times for each song </li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Using these ideas, I created a very basic sketch in Figma of the general layout of my page. Note that the information necessary to the filters is intended to be displayed 
                        in a popup once the user hits the info button on the item card. Also of note, I elected to only feature sorting in the aggregator because the filter bubbles take up a significant 
                        amount of vertical space and make the section look cluttered. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Product</h2>
                    <p>I chose to also make a song aggregator, because I love using Spotify and was inspired by the new UI ideas I hadn't seen before as a newbie to Deezer and Youtube Music. 
                        I intend to allow users to easily navigate a song discovery panel by having the option to filter by genre(s) and sort alphabetically, by release date, popularity, and danceability. 
                        (Note that danceability was chosen because it was the most accessible quantifiable metric of song characteristics from the Spotify API.) The aggregator holds the favorited songs and 
                        counts how many total songs have been liked. Because my web page doesn't actually play the songs, there is no need for much of the song data and buttons present in the analyzed UIs, such 
                        as song length and play buttons.

                <p>Through this project I learned to balance information necessary for sorting, filtering, and aggregation with good design so that the page doesn't become cluttered and 
                    visually overwhelming for users. The process of coding this page also served as an exercise in React state management.
